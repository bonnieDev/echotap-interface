## ðŸ§  What is EchoTap?

EchoTap is a touch-based interaction framework for describing pain without words.

It allows users to:

- **Tap** to express pain frequency and intensity  
- **Touch body diagrams** to indicate location and motion-triggered discomfort  
- **Select symbols** representing pain types like burning, stabbing, or pulsing  
- **Capture timing and pressure data** to form a behavioral picture of pain  
- **Export results** for use in home journaling or clinical sharing

It works especially well for:

- Autistic, nonverbal, and neurodivergent users  
- Patients with chronic conditions like fibromyalgia or migraines  
- Children, trauma survivors, or anyone who finds verbal scales ineffective  
- Researchers or clinicians seeking nonverbal behavior-based metrics
